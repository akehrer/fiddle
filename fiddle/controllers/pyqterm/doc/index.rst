   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PyQTermWidget's documentation!
=========================================

Unlike the older pyqonsole this console widget works with PyQt4 and let's you
embed a shell into your application. 

The vt100 terminal emulation code is based on AjaxTerm and WebShell.
