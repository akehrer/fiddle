# fIDDLE
```python
from __future__ import idle
```

fIDDLE is a Python code editor designed as an alternate to Python's default IDLE development environment. It is aimed
at beginning Python programmers and experience Python developers that may not require a full blown IDE for simpler
projects.

fIDDLE has been inspired by the [IDLE Reimagined](https://github.com/asweigart/idle-reimagined) project.
